## DSD Github style guide
* Always revise this README.md file to make it consistent with your upload.
* For the names of all folders and files, replace space by "_" (except PDF files and the files in lab sections)
  For example: instead of "Fundamentals of Data Science", name it "Fundamentals_of_Data_Science".   
  Reason: command lines get confused by spase in some situations.
* Write all README files as Markdown (.md) files as this one
  See the cheatsheet of Markdown here:  
  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists  
  Reason: markdown file can be compiled automatically in Github, and look nice in the browser. Much better than .txt files.
* When upload contents of bootcamp here, try to add the following materials, and make them clearly together:
  + All source files, including pictures, etc. Make sure other people can generate your slides based on them.
  + Sample code, and dataset relavant to that content.
  + PDF file. Since people can read PDF file directly in browser.
* For R code, let's follow [Google's R styple guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml#filenames).
